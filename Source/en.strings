-- A brief on nomenclature:
-- The user-saved pictures that the app shows are referred to as 'screenshots'.
-- The main grid view that shows all of the screenshots together is the capital-G 'Gallery'.
-- The broad groups (either game title, or month and year) that break up the Gallery are known as categories.
-- A screenshot selected by the user to be pinned at the top of the Gallery is called a capital-F 'Favorite', or simply a 'Fave' if space is low.
-- The act of marking a screenshot as a Favorite is known as capital-F 'Favoriting'.
-- The scene that shows a screenshot in full-screen if the user clicks on it is known as the capital-V 'Viewer'.
-- Screenshot metadata, such as the time taken and the name of the game, is known as capital-I 'Info'.
-- Variables that a user can adjust are known as 'settings'. The screen that lets the player manage the majority of these settings is known as capital-O 'Options'.
-- Deleting data specifically used for Scrapbook is known as clearing.
-- Deleting data that can be used outside of Scrapbook (primarily, the user's screenshots), is referred to as deleting.
-- An operation performed on multiple screenshots at a time is referred to as a batch-[verb], e.g. a batch-delete, or a batch-copy.
-- System-specific buttons and actions are referred to according to Playdate's hardware naming conventions (e.g. d-pad, A button, B button, Lock button, System Menu.)
