# Scrapbook
**COMING SOON**

A simple screenshot viewer for Playdate!

Made by [scratchminer](https://github.com/scratchminer) and [rae](https://stuffbyrae.neocities.org).

## What's this all about?
[Playdate](https://play.date) is a handheld game console by [Panic](https://panic.com)! All you need to know about it right now is that it lets you take screenshots at any point during gameplay. While this is a handy feature on it's own, there's *(currently)* no way to view or manage your screenshots directly from the device - you need an external computer to be able to wrangle 'em. So, we decided to make Scrapbook! View, sort, fave, and delete your screenshots, straight from your device.

## Where or how do I get this?
This repo doesn't contain all the necessary components to build the app yourself - sorry about that. With any luck, we'll be releasing Soonâ„¢ though, so check back for more info on where and how you can get it once it's ready for launch!

## Where can I follow the development?
Well, we'll of course be committing stuff here - if you want some way more conversational dev progress though, check out the dev log in the [Playdate Squad Discord server](https://discord.com/channels/675983554655551509/1137371578812874773).
